# Design Patterns

What are Design Patterns?  
**Design Patterns** are used to design reusable, maintainable and extensible object oriented software. Design Patterns are elegant solutions to repeating problems in software design. They are often refferred to as Gang of Four patterns originally written by four authors - *Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides*.
 The Gang of Four design patterns include 23 design patterns in three categories:
 1. Creational
 2. Structural
 3. Behavioural
