# Design Patterns

What are Design Patterns?  
**Design Patterns** are used to design reusable, maintainable and extensible object oriented software. Design Patterns are elegant solutions to repeating problems in software design. They are often refferred to as Gang of Four patterns originally written by four authors - *Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides*. One of the benefit of design patterns is they help us communicate with other developers at a more abstract level. For example, we can say "Hey, let's use the command pattern to improve the code".
 The Gang of Four design patterns include 23 design patterns in three categories:
 1. Creational  
    Creational Design Patterns are about different ways to create objects.
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Factory Method
    - Prototype
    - Singleton

 2. Structural  
    Structural Design Patterns are about the relationship between objects.
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

 3. Behavioural  
    Behavioral Design Patterns are about the interaction or communication between these objects.
    - Chain of responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - [Memento](https://github.com/neetamlimbu/DesignPatterns/tree/master/Behavioural/Memento)
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor
